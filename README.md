## DuoDent Lab site

This is a site that I've been working on for a local business.

## About

The client is the owner of a dental laboratory that is seeking to get new clients. I proposed this site which is built with TypeScript, NextJS 13, TailwindCSS, and React Hook Form. This preview was deployed on Vercel. The site is fully responsive.
