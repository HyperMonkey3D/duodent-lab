## DuoDent Lab site

This is a site that I've been working on for a local business. I woked on both the design and implementation.

## About

The client is the owner of a dental laboratory that is seeking to get new clients. I proposed this site which is built with TypeScript, NextJS 13, TailwindCSS, and React Hook Form. This preview was deployed to Vercel. The site is fully responsive. The design was made using Figma and the animated graphics are Lottie files made with jitter. The form uses formsubmit.
